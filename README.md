Code for the paper "Motion Prediction of Beating Heart Using Spatio-Temporal LSTM". See the [paper](wait to push link)

`cyclePredictWithRNN` works for predicting the result of next time based on trained network.

`LSTM_Prediction` is used to input train and test data, setup hyperparameters of LSTM, and record the error.

`run_PredictionTests` is the entrence of our task , similar to a main function. All function above are called by it.
